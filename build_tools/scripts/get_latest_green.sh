# Finds the most recent ancestor (first parents only) of the given commit
# (default HEAD) for which the ci workflow passed. There are GitHub actions that
# allegedly do this, but they mostly seem to be broken, unlicensed, or both.
# This approach iterates through commits in the history and makes a separate
# call for each. The alternative is collecting all the successful runs and then
# sorting them. Empirically, the latter was much slower. Fetching them already
# sorted does not appear to be an option as GitHub does not document any known
# sort order. Fetching for multiple specific commits at once is similarly not an
# option.
